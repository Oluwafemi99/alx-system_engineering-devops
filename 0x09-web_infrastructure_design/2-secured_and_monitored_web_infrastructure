Security component
Firewalls (3 Total)
Firewall #1: Protects the load balancer from direct internet access.
Firewall #2–4: Protect each web server individually to isolate threats and enforce internal traffic rules.
Purpose:
Prevent unauthorized access.
Filter traffic based on IP, port, and protocol.
Enforce segmentation between public and private zones.
SSL Certificate
Installed on the load balancer to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS.
Purpose:
Encrypts traffic between clients and the infrastructure.
Ensures data confidentiality and integrity.
Builds trust with users by validating the server’s identity.

Monitoring Components
Monitoring Clients (3 Total)
-Installed on each web server.
-Collect logs, metrics, and performance data.
Purpose:
Detect anomalies, errors,  performance bottlenecks, provide visibility into server health and
 traffic patterns and enable alerting and proactive maintenance.


Infrastructure Issues & Limitations
SSL Termination at Load Balancer
-Issue: Traffic between the load balancer and backend servers is unencrypted.
-Risk: Internal traffic could be intercepted if the network is compromised.
-Solution: Use end-to-end encryption or re-encrypt traffic after termination.
Single Writable MySQL Server
-issue: Creates a single point of failure.
-Risk: If the server goes down, no writes can be made.
-Solution: Implement MySQL replication with failover or use multi-primary clustering.
