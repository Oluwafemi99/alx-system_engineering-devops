Components Added & Their Purpose

Additional Server

Purpose: Hosts a dedicated monitoring agent or can be used for future scaling (e.g., caching, analytics).

Why: Improves modularity and allows for better resource allocation and observability.

HAProxy Load Balancer Cluster (2 Nodes)

Purpose: Distributes incoming traffic across web servers.

Why: Clustering ensures high availabilityâ€”if one load balancer fails, the other takes over.

SSL Termination: Handles HTTPS encryption at the edge.

Split Components


Web Server (Nginx):

Serves static content and forwards requests to the app server.

Isolated for performance and security.

Application Server (Gunicorn, Node.js, etc.):

Handles business logic and dynamic content.

Separation allows independent scaling.

Database Server (MySQL):

Stores persistent data.

Dedicated server ensures data integrity and performance.

Technical Benefits of This Architecture

Security: Firewalls and HTTPS protect against unauthorized access and data leaks.

Scalability: Each layer can be scaled independently based on load.

Resilience: HAProxy clustering and component isolation reduce single points of failure.

Maintainability: Easier to update or troubleshoot individual layers.
