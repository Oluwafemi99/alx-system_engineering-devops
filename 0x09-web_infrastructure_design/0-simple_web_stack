Simple web stack
User requests website
In the browser, the user will  access: www.foobar.com, then the browser asks the DNS system: what ip address is this?
DNS responds: “8.8.8.8” (your server's IP).


Request hits your server
The request arrives at Nginx (the web server) on your server at IP 8.8.8.8.


Nginx role
Nginx handles HTTP/HTTPS requests. Serves static files (CSS, images, JS) and passes dynamic requests to the application server.


Application server role (Gunicorn/uWSGI)
It recieves requests from Nginx for dynamic pages and runs your application code. Calls the database if needed.


Database role (MySQL)
Stores data (users, products, bookings,) and responds to queries from the application server.


Response to user
Application server sends generated HTML → Nginx → Internet → User’s browser.

Key Infrastructure Concepts
Server:
 A physical or virtual machine that stores and runs your application, web server, and database.

Domain name:
 Human-friendly address (foobar.com) that maps to your server's IP.

DNS record type for www:
 www is a CNAME or A record pointing to your domain or IP.
If www → IP, it’s an A record.
If www → foobar.com, then it’s a CNAME.
